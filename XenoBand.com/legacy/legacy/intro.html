    <h4>Concept of Operations</h4>
    XenoBand is a music application that can process MIDI information and sound waves.
    In the MIDI part, user can input MIDI events by using MIDI writer to edit binary content of MIDI directly, or they can also draw MIDI events on a GUI, or they can even play the computer keyboard like playing the piano, and the key press sequence is automatically recorded and converted into a series of MIDI events. The user can write MIDI in multiple sound tracks, and then combine these sound tracks to make a complete song.
    In the Wave part, the key feature is to synthesize different types of sound waves with different parameters to create an instrument. The user can choose the types of sound waves and configure their wave frequency, wave amplitude, wave phase and so on, then combine the wave to create a customized instrument.
    To make an entire piece of music, user can choose to use either MIDI track or wave track or mix of both. Eventually these tracks can be mixed into one piece and exported to disk.
